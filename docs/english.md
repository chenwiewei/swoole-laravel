> This package is relied on Swoole. Please make sure that your machine has been installed the Swoole extension. Using this command to install quickly: `pecl install swoole`. Visit the [official website](https://wiki.swoole.com/wiki/page/6.html) for more information.

## Service Provider

You need to register service provider for your application after completed installation. There is different way to register between Laravel and Lumen:

**Laravel**

Add this line of the code to the `providers` array which located in the `config/app.php` file:

```php
[
    'providers' => [
        HuangYi\Swoole\SwooleServiceProvider::class,
    ],
]
```

**Lumen**

Append this line of the code to the `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
$app->register(HuangYi\Swoole\SwooleServiceProvider::class);
```

## Configuration

> This package has very simple configurations. Just make sure the port `1215` is not used by other process if you are lazy to check other configurations.

If you are using Laravel framework, run this command to generate the configuration file:

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="HuangYi\Swoole\SwooleServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

And then, you will find a new file `swoole.php` under the folder `config/`, open it with the editor you like:

`name`: The server name.

`host`: The IP address of the SwooleHttpServer listening. The default value is 127.0.0.1. You can also use `SWOOLE_HOST` to configure it in the file `.env`.

`port`: The port of the SwooleHttpServer listening. The default value is 1215. You can also use `SWOOLE_PORT` to configure it in the file `.env`.

`server`: The SwooleServer's configuration options. Please read the [official document](https://wiki.swoole.com/wiki/page/274.html) for more configuration options. You can freely add options according to your requirements. You can also configure it by using the format like `SWOOLE_SERVER_XXX` in the file `.env`.

`before_start`: A hook before starting swoole http server. This option only supports Closureã€‚

## Command

> The swoole_http_server can only run in cli environment, and this package provides convenient artisan commands to manage it.

Start the swoole_http_server:

```
$ php artisan swoole:http start
```

Stop the swoole_http_server:

```
$ php artisan swoole:http stop
```

Restart the swoole_http_server:

```
$ php artisan swoole:http restart
```

## Nginx Configuration

> swoole_http_server support for Http is not complete, it is recommended that only as the application server, and use the Nginx as a proxy.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your.domain.com;
    root /path/to/laravel/public;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ @swoole;
    }
    
    location @swoole {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header SERVER_PORT $server_port;
        proxy_set_header REMOTE_ADDR $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header HTTPS "on"; // If https
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1215;
    }
}
```

## Notice

You should restart the swoole_http_server after released your code. Because the Laravel program will be kept in memory after the swoole_http_server started. That is one of the reasons why the swoole_http_server has high performance.
